## Zodiac Signs

### Basic Elements

1. Fire
    - Sound: fire crackling
    - Image: flame
    - Text: Bright and dazzling. The foundation from which all other things came. Warmth in even the coldest of times. Wild when uncontrolled, but when controlled is one of the strongest forces, with the potential for destruction and creation.
1. Water
    - Sound: water flowing
    - Image: waves
    - Text: Ever flowing and unstoppable. Constantly changing to adapt to whatever environment it finds itself a part of. Fearless and calming, it forms its own path when none other is presented.
1. Air
    - Sound: wind blowing
    - Image: lines leading into swirls
    - Text: Soothing and crisp. Carries warth and cool through the world. Swirling it gently bends the world to its will. Gently carving serene sculptures from its environment.
1. Earth
    - Sound: stones clashing
    - Image: stone pillars
    - Text: Sturdy and unmoving. Forged from structure and balance it provides ground for everything under the sun. Stubborn at times, but can be slowly molded into breathtaking monuments.
1. Metal
    - Sound: clang
    - Image: crossed sword and axe
    - Text: 
1. Lightning
    - Sound: thunder crack

1. Time
    - Sound: clock ticking
    - Image: clock or pocket watch
    - Text: Ever moving and ever present. Patient and omnipitent it watches over all, gathering wisdom above all others. Though many have sought to control and tame it, all have failed and have succommed (check spelling) to its ceaslessly passing.
1. Space
    - Sound: void, tbd
    - Image: solar system
    - Text: Endless and mysterious. Much is hidden in the vast expanse, but that only peaks curiosity. The inner depths cause self searching and self reflection of what it is to be ourselves.
1. Wood
    - Sound: forest, hitting wood
    - Image: tree
    - Text: Natural and organic. Grows, twists, and turns to suit its needs. Others find shelter amongst its eaves, providing comfort and ease for the creatures of the world.
1. Aether
    - Sound: awing, angelic
    - Image: infinity symbol
    - Text: The material out of reach to man. Heavenly and alluring it draws all towards it, and at the same time is the source of all things. Through it all things are set in motion and are brought into existence.
1. Light
    - Sound: **TBD** *plan to look through YouTube creator studio*
    - Image: white circle with smaller empty circle int the middle, something point outwards
